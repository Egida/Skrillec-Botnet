# Skrillec Botnet
 The New 2022 All-In-One Botnet. Eliminating the process of getting a bunch of botnet related files to start one up. No more hassles!
 
- (1/11/22) This project has slowed down in development 
Picking up the Wocky series. 

## Why did Wocky end? / What happen to Wocky?

V1 was planned and developed with a few slackers. Ended up creating 95% of the net alone. V1 was planned to have the most nesscary features. V2.0.0 was planned to bring a whole new designing system around but ended up being a mess due to the amount of code everywhere. Messy and unorganized.

## Whats coming soon?

Information about the botnet is not to be said until release. Big surprises tho
The last final NET coming to public soon. This next version will be the All-In-One Botnet that has every file you need including scanning files

## Exclusive features:
- UI (Layout)
- Easier Net Branding / Setup
- an official CLI
- LIVE Multi-Text Updating
- Command branding with an Official Interpeted language 
- Becoming a home, have friends, join chatrooms etc
